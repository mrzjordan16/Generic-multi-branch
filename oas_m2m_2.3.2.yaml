          - Reporting
        description: |
          This operation enables consumers to retrieve a report from Connectivity Management Platform (CMP) based on the specified report Id. 
          
          ## Supported File Types:-
          The supported file types of report are CSV, PDF and Excel.
          
          ## Response Headers 
          **1- Content-Type**
          The default content type is application/octet-stream. These octet-stream files are arbitrary binary data files that might be in .csv or .pdf or .xls format.


          **2- Content-Disposition**
          The Content-Disposition response header field conveys additional information about how to process the response payload. The Content-Disposition header field is defined as follows:
              "Content-Disposition" ":" disposition-type ";" disposition-param)
               ```Example Content-Disposition:attachment; filename = CDR Report 2021-08-16-Shaden.csv ```
         
          ***disposition-type***: The default value of disposition-type is being set as "attachment". Indicates that the user-agent should not display the response, but instead show a "Save As" dialog so that user can download the report as an attachement and save it locally.
          
          ***disposition-param - filename***:  The suggested filename for an eventual "Save As" dialog presented to the user. It could be used as a basis for the actual filename, where possible.

          - SMS
        description: |
          This operation enables consumers to send SMS messages either in a text or binary mode to a group of SIM cards at once.
          
          **Communication Style/ API Processing Pattern**:  Asynchronous Request-Response with Polling.
            Asynchronous operations create transactions in the M2M platform, and then return a transaction ID which can be used to query the status of the asynchronous operation by calling the **GET** ​/transactions​/{**transactionId**}​/status. The execution time of an asynchronous operation depends on the number of entities involved into the operation. 
            **Note:** The response header 'X-STC-API-TargetMsgRef' refers the transaction Id.
          
          # Request Fields 
            
          ## binary: a boolean flag 
          The value of this field is to be set as 'true' to send the binary message. The default value of this field is 'false' which implies that a message is to be sent in text mode.  
          
          ## deliveryReceipt: Delivery Receipt (DLR) - a boolean flag 
          A Delivery Receipt (DLR), also known as Delivery Report, is a special type of message which indicates the final state of a SMS. The value of this field is to be set as 'true' to receive delivery receipts for the SMSs that are delivered. The default value of this field is 'false' which implies that a Delivery Receipt is not requested by default for every SMS submission.            
          
          ## identifier: SIM Identifier 
          The SIM cards/identifier can be filtered by
          - ICCID
          - IMSI
          - MSISDN
          - Label
          
          **Note:**  If the identifier parameter is set to MSISDN, then it is possible for you, as a platform user, to send bulk SMSs to SIM cards that do not belong to the platform. While in case the identifier parameter is set to ICCID or IMSI, then the provided group of SIM cards, in the request, must belong to the platform.
          
          ## pin: PIN Verification Feature
          To send an SMS through this API operation, the PIN number, as stored in the SIM’s details, can be used as an additional security method to verify the allowed devices that can send SMS messages.
          
          This feature must first be enabled for your account. Once this is done, the bulk SMS will only be sent to the SIM cards whose PIN numbers match the PIN entries from the API call.For the SIM cards whose PIN numbers do not match the PIN entries, the message will not be delivered or charged, and an error message shall be returned.
          
          The PIN verification feature is neither enabled for SIM cards that are not included on the M2M Platform, nor enabled while using the platform GUI to perform the operation.

            **Communication Style/ API Processing Pattern**: Asynchronous.
            - **Pull the transaction status of an asynchronous operation.**
            Asynchronous operations create transactions in the M2M platform, and then return a transaction ID which can be used to query the status of the asynchronous operation by calling the **GET** ​/transactions​/{**transactionId**}​/status. The execution time of an asynchronous operation depends on the number of entities involved into the operation. 
            **Note:** The response header 'X-STC-API-TargetMsgRef' refers the transaction Id.
            
          ## Request Fields      
          
          ### Identifier:
            The SIMs can be filtered by one of the below identifiers.
            * ICCID
            * IMSI 
            * MSISDN
            * LABEL
            
          ### simIds[] Maximum Length:  
           This has a restriction of 500 SIM cards per request, at maximum, based on the SIM cards’ identifiers.    
          
          ## Authorization Note:-
          This resource requires a valid OAuth2.0 access token for consumer who is not within stc network. Make sure you have the right scope for this API resource.

        description: |
          This operation enables consumer to create sims termination case of given SIM cards. You, as a platform user, can only terminate the SIM cards that are owned by your customer or by one of its business units. 
            Kindly note that sims will not be terminated promptly but the request will go through the **'Termination and Retention'** process before it got handled. The platform will initially suspend the given sim cards, create a case of sims termination and assign it to **Retention Team**. The retention team will attempt to negotiate with the customer. If a customer accepts the retention offer the given sim cards are to be resumed. In case of rejection of retention offer the given sims cards to be disconnected. 
          
            **Communication Style/ API Processing Pattern**: Asynchronous.
            - **Pull the transaction status of an asynchronous operation.**
            Asynchronous operations create transactions in the M2M platform, and then return a transaction ID which can be used to query the status of the asynchronous operation by calling the **GET** ​/transactions​/{**transactionId**}​/status. The execution time of an asynchronous operation depends on the number of entities involved into the operation. 
            **Note:** The response header 'X-STC-API-TargetMsgRef' refers the transaction Id.
            
          ## Request Fields      
          
          ### Identifier:
            The SIMs can be filtered by one of the below identifiers.
            * ICCID
            * IMSI 
            * MSISDN
            * LABEL
            
          ### simIds[] Maximum Length:  
           This has a restriction of 500 SIM cards per request, at maximum, based on the SIM cards’ identifiers.    
          
          ## Authorization Note:-
          This resource requires a valid OAuth2.0 access token for consumer who is not within stc network. Make sure you have the right scope for this API resource.
